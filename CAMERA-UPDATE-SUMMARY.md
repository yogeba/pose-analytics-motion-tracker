# Camera Interface Updates Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed Pose Detection Rendering
- Created `useSimplePoseDetectionFixed.ts` with proper skeleton rendering
- Fixed connection drawing order (connections before keypoints)
- Added proper MoveNet skeleton connections for all 17 keypoints
- Enhanced visual effects with glow and proper stroke styles

### 2. ✅ Made iOS Native Camera UI Default
- Changed initial `appState` from 'idle' to 'camera'
- Set `showNativeUI` to `true` by default
- Added auto-start camera functionality on component mount
- Camera now starts automatically when the app loads

### 3. ✅ Implemented Mode Switching Functionality
- Enhanced `handleModeChange` with mode-specific behavior:
  - **POSE**: Enables pose detection with skeleton overlay
  - **VIDEO**: Standard video recording without overlay
  - **PHOTO**: Single frame capture with download
  - **ANALYSIS**: Pose detection with enhanced metrics
  - **SLO-MO**: High FPS recording (60fps) for slow motion

### Mode-Specific Features

#### POSE Mode
- Real-time pose detection with skeleton overlay
- 30 FPS recording with pose data included
- Cyan-colored keypoints with connections

#### VIDEO Mode
- Standard video recording
- No pose overlay
- 30 FPS high-quality recording

#### PHOTO Mode
- Single frame capture
- Automatic download as JPEG
- Mirrors the display view

#### ANALYSIS Mode
- Pose detection enabled
- Photo capture includes pose overlay
- Enhanced metrics tracking

#### SLO-MO Mode
- 60 FPS recording for smooth slow motion
- No pose overlay for performance
- High-quality capture

## Technical Implementation

### Auto-Start Camera
```typescript
// Camera now starts automatically on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (isInitialized && videoRef.current && appState === 'camera') {
    await startCamera(videoRef.current)
    // Auto-start pose detection for pose mode
  }
}, [isInitialized])
```

### Mode-Based Recording Configuration
```typescript
switch (cameraMode) {
  case 'pose':
  case 'analysis':
    // Include pose overlay, 30 FPS
  case 'video':
    // No overlay, 30 FPS
  case 'slo-mo':
    // No overlay, 60 FPS
}
```

### Photo Capture
- Creates temporary canvas
- Mirrors image to match display
- Downloads as JPEG with timestamp

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Instant Camera Access**: No need to click "Start Camera"
2. **Seamless Mode Switching**: Real-time mode changes without interruption
3. **Mode-Appropriate Features**: Each mode optimized for its purpose
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for active mode and features

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement camera toggle (front/back)
- [ ] Add exposure/focus controls
- [ ] Implement cinematic mode
- [ ] Add professional recording indicators
- [ ] Optimize for 30+ FPS performance

## Testing Instructions

1. Load the app - camera should start automatically
2. Test mode switching using the bottom selector
3. Verify pose detection only runs in POSE/ANALYSIS modes
4. Test photo capture in PHOTO mode
5. Test recording in each mode to verify correct behavior
