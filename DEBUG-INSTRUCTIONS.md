# Pose Detection Debugging Instructions

## Issue: Skeleton Connections Not Rendering

The pose detection keypoints are visible but the skeleton connections between them are not rendering.

## Debugging Setup

1. **Start the Next.js app** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, start the debug server**:
   ```bash
   npm run debug:server
   ```
   This will:
   - Launch Puppeteer with a visible browser window
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001
   - Inject debugging hooks into the canvas rendering
   - Start an API server on port 4000

3. **In another terminal, run debug commands**:
   ```bash
   # Run full debug sequence
   npm run debug:run
   
   # Or run individual commands:
   npm run debug:client status    # Check current status
   npm run debug:client fix       # Apply canvas fixes
   npm run debug:client test      # Draw test skeleton
   npm run debug:client loop      # Check detection loop
   ```

## Fix Applied

The issue was in the `renderPose` function in `useSimplePoseDetection.ts`. The skeleton connections were not being drawn properly. 

**Root Cause**: The connections array was defined but the drawing logic wasn't executing properly due to:
1. Shadow blur effects interfering with line rendering
2. Incorrect drawing order (keypoints were drawn before lines)
3. Missing stroke style configuration

**Solution**: Created `useSimplePoseDetectionFixed.ts` with:
- Proper connection definitions for MoveNet's 17 keypoints
- Drawing connections BEFORE keypoints (so lines appear behind)
- Proper shadow and stroke configuration
- Enhanced visual feedback with glow effects

## Testing the Fix

1. The component now uses `useSimplePoseDetectionFixed` hook
2. Start the app and click "Start Camera"
3. You should see:
   - Cyan-colored keypoints with glow effects
   - Connecting lines between keypoints forming a skeleton
   - Confidence score and keypoint count in top-left
   - Smooth animation with proper mirroring

## Debug Server API Endpoints

- `GET /debug/status` - Get canvas and rendering state
- `POST /debug/fix-canvas` - Force canvas visibility
- `POST /debug/test-skeleton-render` - Draw test skeleton
- `POST /debug/inject-render-hook` - Add render logging
- `POST /debug/check-pose-loop` - Check detection loop

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Skeleton rendering fixed
2. ðŸ”„ Make native UI default (remove glassmorphism intro)
3. ðŸ”„ Implement mode switching functionality
4. ðŸ”„ Add camera controls (exposure, focus, zoom)
5. ðŸ”„ Optimize performance for 30+ FPS

## Cleanup

After debugging, you can remove these files:
- `debug-server.js`
- `debug-client.js`
- `DEBUG-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Keep `useSimplePoseDetectionFixed.ts` as the production implementation.
